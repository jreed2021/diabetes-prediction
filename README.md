#Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical data. The dataset comes from the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, a well-known dataset in healthcare analytics.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing correlations and distributions.
- 
## Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling.
- Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression for prediction.
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 768 samples and 8 features:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

### Data Source
- UCI Machine Learning Repository ([Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes))

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/jreed2021/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
   
2. Install dependencies:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Open Jupyter Notebook and run diabetes_prediction.ipynb:
   bash
   jupyter notebook
   

## Results
- Model Accuracy: Achieved over 75% accuracy in predictions.
- Visualization: Correlation heatmaps, confusion matrix, and feature distributions.

## Future Enhancements
- Experiment with different ML models (Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks).
- Implement feature engineering for better predictions.
- Deploy as a web application** using Streamlit.
